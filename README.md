# game-of-war
Two players start the game by splitting a deck of 52 standard playing cards evenly. Each stack is facedown, and players cannot look at the cards in their stack or rearrange them.

The objective of the game is to play until one player has all 52 cards in their stack.

# Development 
War is built in Javascript with the use of data types, loops, function, and object-oriented programming.

# Challenges
The main challenge I face building this game was how to think like a programmer and not to get ahead of myself.
